              <p>
                Director Phoenix only funds charity projects. This, with
                infighting between the Eagles, has led to a significant economic
                decline of the Wilds of Agrestia.
              </p>
              <p>
                No Eagle could persuade Director Phoenix to fund anything that
                would assist Agrestia&apos;s economy.
              </p>
              <p>
                That is, until the Headmaster of the Academy has persuaded
                Phoenix, the Director of Agrestia to fund a grand academy under
                the pretense that it&apos;s for education.
              </p>
              <p>
                In reality, the Headmaster&apos;s hope is that the Soleira
                Prestigia can create graduates who will bring Agrestia back to
                its full glory.
