              Director Phoenix only funds charity projects. This, with
              infighting between the Eagles, has led to a significant economic
              decline of the Wilds of Agrestia.

              No Eagle could persuade Director Phoenix to fund anything that

              That is, until the Headmaster of the Academy has persuaded
              Phoenix, the Director of Agrestia to fund a grand academy under
              the pretense that it&quot;s for education.

              In reality, the Headmaster&quot;s hope is that the Soleira

              full glory.
